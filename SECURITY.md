**Note:** Please do not report such issues publicly on the issue tracker. The
*issue tracker is intended for bug reports and feature requests.

## Responding to Reports

A protobom maintainer will respond to the report as soon as possible. After the
report is triaged and the vulnerability is confirmed, a fix will be prepared
under embargo. Once the fix is accepted, a new release will be prepared along
with a report detailing the vulnerability. This report will identify the
reporter unless they request to be kept anonymous. Finally, a CVE may be
requested if appropriate for the vulnerability report.
